A datapack that makes everything bounce!

This datapack was a fun side project I made. Currently it makes everything in the world bounce (including things that probably shouldn't, like paintings)

I'll hopefully add some new features to this, for example:
  * Bouncy pearls. A craftable ender pearl that bounces. There would be some way of making it stop, like sneaking.
  * Selective bouncing. Only some entities would bounce, like slimeballs.
  * Optimizations, such as running once every 5 ticks to save on performance.
